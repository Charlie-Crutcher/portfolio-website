            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In this lesson we will be looking at what happens when we put "flex: 1" on flex items.
            </p><br>

            <h3>The flex shorthand</h3>
            <p>
                The "flex" declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set
                on a flex item. These 3 properties affect how flex items size themselves within
                their container. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So dib {flex: 1;} equates to: flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0.
                Very often the flex shorthand is defined with only one value, in this case, the
                value is applied to flex-grow, so when we put flex: 1, we were actually specifying
                a shorthand of flex: 1 1 0.
            </p>
            <h4>Flex-grow</h4>
            <p>
                flex-grow expects a single number as its value, with that number being used as the
                flex-item's "growth factor". When we apply flex: 1 to every div inside a container,
                we are telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div
                ends up being the same size. Instead, if we add "flex: 2" to just one of these divs,
                that div would grow to 2x the size of the others! Smart stuff!
            </p>
            <h4>Flex-shrink</h4>
            <p>
                flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow but instead sets the "shrink factor" of a flex
                item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger
                than their parent container. The default shrink factor is 1, which means all items
                will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;.
            </p>
            <h4>Flex-basis</h4>
            <p>
                flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or
                flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to
                flex-basis: 0%.
            </p>
            <h4>flex: auto</h4>
            <p>
                We have mentioned flex: auto, but what is this? flex-auto is one of the shorthands
                of flex. When auto is defined as a flex keyword, it is equivalent to the values of
                flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex
                shorthand. Note, flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand
                despite the name being "auto".
            </p>
            <h4>In practice</h4>
            <p>
                In practice, it is uncommon that we will use complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink
                or flex-basis. Generally, you're most likely to use declarations like flex: 1, to make
                divs grow evenly, and flex-shrink: 0, to keep divs from shrinking.
