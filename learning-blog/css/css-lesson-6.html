            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways to move elements around on a web page, with some being newer
                than others and others falling out of style. The debut of flexbox however, was
                revolutionary. It is now considered to be the default way of positioning elements
                for many developers.
            </p><br>

            <!-- A warning on flexbox's complexity -->
            <h3>Before we start</h3>
            <p>
                Flexbox layouts can be complicated. The browser's developer tools will be vital
                in the following lessons, and should be the first step of action every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst flexbox isn't necessarily more difficult than the other concepts that we've
                covered, it does have an increased complexity. It may take a while to make use of
                any of the things we are going to learn in these first lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always come back and reference these lessons if you are struggling, but remember,
                its not a race.
            </p><br>

            <!-- Flexbox -->
            <h3>Flexbox</h3>
            <p>
                Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex based
                on the rules that you define.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if we set our flex-container element to "display: flex", and our
                flex-container item's element to "flex: 1", all the items inside the flexbox will
                be horizontally aligned.
            </p>
            <h4>Flex containers and flex items</h4>
            <p>
                Flexbox isn't just a CSS property, it is a whole toolbox of properties that you can
                use to put things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on a flex
                container, while some go on the flex items. This is an important concept0
            </p>
            <p>
                A flex container is any element that has "display: flex" on it. A flex item is
                any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.
            </p>
            <p>
                To complicate things, any element can be both a flex container <b>and</b> a flex
                item. Said another way, you can also put "display: flex" on a flex item and then
                use flexbox to arrange its children. Essentially a flex item, within a flex container,
                with another flex container as a child of that flex item.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating and nesting flex containers and items is the primary way we will be building
                up complex layouts. Flexbox is a very powerful tool that can achieve this for us.
