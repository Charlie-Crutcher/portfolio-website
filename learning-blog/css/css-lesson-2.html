            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The previous lesson covered basic CSS syntax and selectors. In this lesson, we will
                combine our knowledge of selectors with the C of CSS - the cascade.
            </p><br>

            <!-- The Cascade -->
            <h3>The cascade of CSS</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes we may have conflicting rules, which may lead to some unexpected results.
                It's important to understand that CSS doesn't do this just to annoy us, it will only
                do what <em>we</em> tell it to do. One exception to this rule is the default styles
                provided by a browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you end up with unexpected behavior, it's either because of default styles, a 
                misunderstanding of how a property works, or not understanding <em>the cascade</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                the cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML pages.
                There are different factors that the cascade will use to determine this. We will
                examine three of these factors, which hopefully will help avoid frustration when
                using CSS.
            </p><br>

            <h4>Specificity</h4>
            <p>
                A specific declaration in CSS will always take precedence over a less specific one.
                For examples, inline styles have the highest specificity compared to selectors,
                while each type of selector has its own specificity level that contributes to how
                specific a declaration is.
            </p>
            <o>
                <li>ID Selectors - Most specific</li>
                <li>Class Selectors</li>
                <li>Type Selectors</li>
            </o>
            <p>
                Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple declarations.
                An ID selector will always beat any number of class selector, while a class selector
                will always beat any number of type selectors, and so on. when there is no declaration 
                with a selector of higher specificity, a rule with a greater number of selectors of the 
                same type will take precedence.
            </p><br>

            <h4>Inheritance</h4>
            <p>
                Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element,
                are inherited by that element's descendants, even if a rule isn't explicitly written
                for those descendants. Typography-based properties such as <em>color</em>,
                <em>font-size</em> or <em>font-family</em> are usually inherited, but most other
                properties are not.
            </p><br>
            
            <h4>Rule order</h4>
            <p>
                After every other factor has been taken into account, but there are still multiple 
                conflicting rules targeting an element, the rule that was <em>last</em> defined 
                takes precedence.
            </p><br>
