            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Now we have established how to write the HTML that structures our webpages, we can 
                now start to add some <em>style</em> to our pages, which is what CSS is for.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- Basic CSS syntax -->
            <h3>Basic syntax</h3>
            <p>
                At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up 
                of a selector and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, with each of those
                declarations being made up of a property-value pair.
            </p>
            <img href="../../images/css/basic-syntax.jpg">
            <br>

            <!-- Selectors -->
            <h3>Selectors</h3>
            <p>
                Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which the CSS rules apply to; they are what
                are being 'selected' for each CSS rule. Below, we will go through the most common 
                subsections used in CSS.
            </p>
            <h4>Universal selector</h4>
            <p>
                The universal selector selects elements of any time. It consists of a simple asterisk (*).
            </p>
            <h4>Type selectors</h4>
            <p>
                The type selector (or element selector), selects all elements of the given element 
                type, with the syntax just being the name of the element. For example: we could use
                div {color: white;}, which would select all div elements.
            </p>
            <h4>Class selectors</h4>
            <p>
                Class selectors select all elements with the given class, which is just an
                attribute placed on a HTML element. For example div class="alert" in HTML, would be
                .alert {color: red;} in CSS, only changing this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class selector syntax within CSS start with a period, followed by the case-sensitive
                value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular
                element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you would like.
            </p>
            <h4>ID selectors</h4>
            <p>
                ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given 
                ID, which again is an attribute placed on a HTML element. The difference between 
                classes and IDs is that an element can only have <b>one</b> ID. It cannot be repeated
                on a single page and should not contain any whitespace.
            </p>
            <p>
                ID selector syntax start with a hashtag, followed by the case-sensitive value of
                the ID attribute. You should use IDs <b>sparingly</b>, as in most instances, simply 
                using classes will suffice.
            </p>
            <h4>The grouping selector</h4>
            <p>
                What if we had two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?
            </p>
            <p>
                We can cut down on repetition by grouping two selectors together, as a comma-separated
                list. For example:
            </p>
            <img href="../../images/css/group-selectors.jpeg">
            <h4>Chaining selectors</h4>
            <p>
                Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation.
            </p>
            <p>
                div class='subsection header'<br>
                p class='subsection preview'
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we have two elements with the <em>subsection</em> class, that have some sort 
                of unique styles. What if we only wanted to apply a separate rule to the element 
                that also has <em>header</em> as a second class? We could chain both the class
                selectors together in CSS.
            </p>
            <p>.subsection.header {color: red;}</p>
            <p>
                What <em>.subsection.header</em> does is selects any element that has both the 
                <em>subsection</em> and <em>header</em> classes. This can also be used to chain a 
                class and an ID, (.subsection#preview) like so.
            </p>
            <h4>Descendant combinator</h4>
            <p>
                Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping
                or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four
                types of combinators in total, but for now we're only going to discuss the <b>Descendant 
                    combinator</b>, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A 
                    descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected
                    if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something such as .ancestor .child, would select an element with the class 'child'
                if it has an ancestor with the class <em>ancestor</em>. Another way to think of it
                is that <em>child</em> will only be selected if it is nested inside <em>ancestor</em>,
                regardless of how deep that nesting is.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no real limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so .one .two 
                .three .four would work. It would just select an element that has a class of four
                if it has an ancestor with the class of three, if that had its own ancestor with a
                class of two etc.
            </p><br>

            <!-- Most common CSS properties -->
            <h3>Properties to get started with</h3>
            <p>
                Some CSS properties are going to be used all of the time. Some of the most commonly
                used properties used in CSS will be discussed below, but this is by no means a complete
                list. It will however be enough to help get you started.
            </p>
            <h4>Color and background-color</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>color</b> property sets an element's <b>text color</b>, while <b>background-color</b>
                sets the <b>background color</b> of an element. It is just annoying how it isn't
                spelt correctly!
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common value
                is a keyword, such as a color name like <em>red</em>, or the <em>transparent</em>
                keyword. They also accept HEX, RGB and HSL values, allowing for further customisation.
            </p>
            <h4>Typography basics and text-align</h4>
            <p>
                <em>font-family</em> can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that
                determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories,
                a 'font family name', such as <em>"Times New Roman"</em>, or a 'generic family name',
                like <em>serif</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the user's browser cannot find or doesn't support the first font in a list, it will
                use the next one, which is why it is best practice to have a generic font family as
                a fallback, such as "Times New Roman" or serif.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>font-size</em> sets the size of the font, whilst <em>font-weight</em> affects
                the boldness of the text. <em>text-align</em> aligns text horizontally within an
                element. You can use common keywords such as text-align: center, or text-align: left.
            </p>
            <h4>Image height and width</h4>
            <p>
                While images aren't the only elements that we are able to adjust the height and width
                of, we are focusing on them specifically in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, an img elements height and width values will be the same as the actual
                image file's height and width. To adjust the size of the image without causing it to
                lose its proportions, you could use a value of "auto" for the height property,
                and simply adjust the width value accordingly.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Adding CSS to HTML</h3>
            <h4>External CSS</h4>
            <p>
                This is the most common method of adding CSS to HTML. It consists of creating a
                separate file for the CSS and linking it to the HTML page, inside the 'head' element.
                This is done using the &lt;link&gt; element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The advantages of using external CSS is that:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It keeps our HTML and CSS separate. This keeps the HTML file smaller and cleaner looking.</li>
                <li>The CSS can be edited in <em>one</em> place.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Internal CSS</h4>
            <p>
                Also known as embedded CSS, this involves adding CSS within the HTML file. With this
                method, you place all the rules inside a pair of opening and closing &lt;style&gt;
                tags, which are placed inside of the opening and closing &lt;head&gt; tags in the 
                HTML file. This method does not require a &lt;link&gt; element.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this method can be useful for adding unique styles to a <em>single page</em>
                of a website, it doesn't keep things separate, and can cause the HTML file to get
                pretty big.
            </p>
            <h4>Inline CSS</h4>
            <p>
                This method allows you to add CSS styles directly into HTML elements, however this
                method isn't as recommended. This is due to a couple of reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It can quickly become messy, causing bloat to the HTML file.</li>
                <li>It can cause unnecessary repetition and more bloat.</li>
                <li>Inline CSS overrides the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results.</li>
            </ol><br>
