            <h2>CSS: Lesson 1</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
            <h3>Date: 7th October 2024</h3>
            <p>
                Now we have established how to write the HTML that structures our webpages, we can 
                now start to add some <em>style</em> to our pages, which is what CSS is for.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Basic syntax</h4>
            <p>
                At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up 
                of a selector and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, with each of those
                declarations being made up of a property-value pair.
            </p>
            <img href="../../images/css/basic-syntax.jpg">
            <br>

            <h4>Selectors</h4>
            <p>
                Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which the CSS rules apply to; they are what
                are being 'selected' for each CSS rule. Below, we will go through the most common 
                subsections used in CSS.
            </p>
            <h5>Universal selector</h5>
            <p>
                The universal selector selects elements of any time. It consists of a simple asterisk (*).
            </p>
            <h5>Type selectors</h5>
            <p>
                The type selector (or element selector), selects all elements of the given element 
                type, with the syntax just being the name of the element. For example: we could use
                div {color: white;}, which would select all div elements.
            </p>
            <h5>Class selectors</h5>
            <p>
                Class selectors select all elements with the given class, which is just an
                attribute placed on a HTML element. For example div class="alert" in HTML, would be
                .alert {color: red;} in CSS, only changing this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class selector syntax within CSS start with a period, followed by the case-sensitive
                value of the class attribute. Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular
                element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you would like.
            </p>
            <h5>ID selectors</h5>
            <p>
                ID selectors are similar to class selectors. They select an element with the given 
                ID, which again is an attribute placed on a HTML element. The difference between 
                classes and IDs is that an element can only have <b>one</b> ID. It cannot be repeated
                on a single page and should not contain any whitespace.
            </p>
            <p>
                ID selector syntax start with a hashtag, followed by the case-sensitive value of
                the ID attribute. You should use IDs <b>sparingly</b>, as in most instances, simply 
                using classes will suffice.
            </p>
            <h5>The grouping selector</h5>
            <p>
                What if we had two groups of elements that share some of their style declarations?
            </p>
            <p>
                We can cut down on repetition by grouping two selectors together, as a comma-separated
                list. For example:
            </p>
            <img href="../../images/css/group-selectors.jpeg">
            <h5>Chaining selectors</h5>
            <p>
                Another way to use selectors is to chain them as a list without any separation.
            </p>
            <p>
                div class='subsection header'<br>
                p class='subsection preview'
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we have two elements with the <em>subsection</em> class, that have some sort 
                of unique styles. What if we only wanted to apply a separate rule to the element 
                that also has <em>header</em> as a second class? We could chain both the class
                selectors together in CSS.
            </p>
            <p>.subsection.header {color: red;}</p>
            <p>
                What <em>.subsection.header</em> does is selects any element that has both the 
                <em>subsection</em> and <em>header</em> classes. This can also be used to chain a 
                class and an ID, (.subsection#preview) like so.
            </p>
            <h5>Descendant combinator</h5>
            <p>
                Combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping
                or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors. There are four
                types of combinators in total, but for now we're only going to discuss the <b>Descendant 
                    combinator</b>, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors. A 
                    descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected
                    if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector.
            </p>
