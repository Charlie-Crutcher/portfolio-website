            <!-- Introduction Paragraph -->
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The previous lesson discussed how different display types have unique box models,
                and we can modify the box calculation by changing the display property. But CSS has
                two box types: block and inline boxes, which determine element behaviour and
                interaction. The display property controls how HTML elements appear on the webpage,
                and we will delve into its various options further in this lesson.
            </p><br>

            <!-- Block elements vs inline elements -->
             <h3>Block vs inline</h3>
             <p>
                Most elements that we have discussed so far have been block elements. By default,
                element styles are set to display: block. These will appear on the page stacked on
                top of each other, with each element starting a new line.
             </p>
             <p>
                Inline elements do not start a new line. As their name would suggest, they appear
                in line with whatever elements are placed beside it. An example of an inline element
                is a link, or an anchor tag, as when you place one in the middle of a paragraph, the
                link will behave as if it is part of the paragraph.
             </p>
             <p>
                Padding and margin also behave differently for inline elements. Generally, you do not
                want to try to put extra padding or margins on inline elements.
             </p>
             <h4>The middle ground inline-block</h4>
             <p>
                Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margins.
                display: inline-block is a useful tool we can use, but usually we will instead be
                using the flexbox more often if we are lining up multiple boxes. Flexbox will be
                discussed further in the next lesson.
             </p><br>

             <!-- Divs and spans -->
              <h3>Divs and spans</h3>
              <p>
                All of the HTML elements we have discussed give meaning to their content. For example,
                paragraph elements tell the browser to display the text it contains as a paragraph.
                Strong elements tell the browser which texts within are important etc. Divs and spans however,
                give no particular meaning to their content, as they are just generic boxes that
                contain anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having elements like this available can be useful. Often, we will need elements to
                serve no other purpose than to be 'hook' elements. We can hive an id or class to
                target them for styling with CSS. Another use case we will face regularly is grouping
                related elements under one parent element to position them correctly on the page.
                Divs and spans provide us with the ability to do this.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default, a div is a block-level element. It is commonly used as a container element
                to group other elements. They allow us to <em>divide</em> the page into different
                blocks and apply styling to these blocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default, a span is an inline-level element. It can be used to group text
                and inline HTML elements for styling, and should only be used when no other
                semantic HTML element is appropriate.
              </p>
