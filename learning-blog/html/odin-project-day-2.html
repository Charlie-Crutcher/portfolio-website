            <h2>Lesson 1 - Working with Text</h2>
            <p>
                Most content on the web is text-based, which means working with HTML text elements is a common
                occurance when building web pages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Paragraphs.</h4>
            <p>
                If we wanted to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element, which will add
                a new line after each paragraph. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tag.
            </p>
            <h4>Headings.</h4>
            <p>
                Headings are different from other HTML text elements, as they are displayed larger
                and bolder than other text to distinguish they are headings.
            </p>
            <p>There are six levels of headings, starting from <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> being the largest, and
                <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b> being the smallest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the correct level of heading is important, as levels provide a hierarchy to the
                content. A h1 heading should <b>always</b> be used for the heading of the overall page, with 
                lower level headings being used for headings in small sections of the page.
            </p>
            <h4>Strong Element.</h4>
            <p>
                The strong element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important, which affects
                accessibility tools such as screen readers. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change
                to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element. To define a strong element,
                we simply wrap text in a <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> tag.
            </p>
            <h4>Em Element.</h4>
            <p>
                The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text.
            </p>
            <h4>Nesting and Indentation.</h4>
            <p>
                Any time you indent elements within another element, this is called nesting elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                This creates a parent and a child relationship between the two elements. The nested
                elements will be the children of the parent it is nested within.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nesting and indentation makes our HTML much easier to read, both for ourselves and
                for any possible future developers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The parent, child and sibling relationships between elements becomes much more important
                when adding CSS and JavaScript, but for now it is important to know the distinction
                between how elements are related, and the terminology used to describe their relationships.
            </p>
            <h4>HTML Comments.</h4>
            <p>
                HTML comments are not visible to the browser, allowing us to comment on our code so that
                other developers or our future selves can read them to get some context about the code written.
            </p>
            <p>Comments in HTML can be written with the &lt;!-- and --&gt; tags. </p>

            <h2>Lesson 2 - Lists</h2>
            <p>
                Lists are everywhere on the web, and you are eventually going to need to use them.
                Luckily though, HTMl offers a couple of different types of lists we can implement.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Unordered Lists.</h4>
            <p>
                If you want to have a list of items where the order isn't particularly important,
                such as a shopping list of items, then you can use an unordered list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unordered lists are created using the &lt;ul&gt; element, with each item within the list 
                being nested within this ul element with the &lt;li&gt; element.
            </p>
            <h4>Ordered Lists.</h4>
            <p>
                When you need to create a list of items where the order <em>does</em> matter, such as 
                a top 10 list, then you can use an ordered list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ordered lists are created using the &lt;ol&gt; element, with each item within the list
                being declared the same as the unordered list. The only difference is that these items
                will be numbered, from top to bottom.
            </p>
            <h4>Unordered List Example.</h4>
            <p>Unordered Shopping List:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Cereal</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ordered List Example.</h4>
            <p>Top Five Films:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Taxi Driver</li>
                <li>Defiance</li>
                <li>Lord of the Rings</li>
                <li>Troy</li>
                <li>A Bridge too Far.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Lesson 3 - Links and Images.</h2>
            <p>
                Links are one of the key features of HTML. Links allow us to link to other HTML pages
                on the web, which is why it's called the web!
            </p>
            <h4>Anchor Elements.</h4>
            <p>
                To create a link in HTML, we use the <b>anchor element</b>. An anchor element is defined
                by wrapping text or elements we want to become a link in a &lt;a&gt; tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just an anchor element will not link us to any web page however, as we need to tell it
                where to take us. We can do this by using a HTML attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                A HTML attribute or href, gives additional information to an element and <b>always</b>
                goes in the element's opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name,
                and a value, but not all attributes require a value.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make an anchor tag redirect us to a different web page, we can combine the anchor tag
                with a HTML attribute.
            </p>
            <h4>Opening Links in a New Tab.</h4>
            <p>
                In order to open an anchor element's link in a new tab, we need to add another attribute:
                the <b>target</b> attribute. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While <b>href</b> specifies the destination link, <b>target</b> specifies where the linked
                resource will be opened. If it is not present, by default, it will take on the <b>_self</b>
                value, which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab,
                you can set the target attribute to <b>_blank</b>.
            </p>
            <h4>Relationship Attribue.</h4>
            <p>
                The relationship, or rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current
                page and the linked document in an anchor tag.
            </p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> rel="noopener noreferrer"</p>
            <p>
                The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage
                from which it was opened.
            </p>
            <p>
                The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource
                has a link (or reference) to it.
            </p>
            <p><b>Why add these?</b> Security. The prevention of access that is caused by the noopener
            prevents phishing attacks.</p>
            <h4>Absolute and Relative Links.</h4>
            <p>
                There are generally two kinds of links used with HTML; links to pages on other websites,
                and links to pages located on our own website.
            </p>
            <p><b>Absolute Links</b> are links to pages on other websites on the internet. The entire address 
            of the website must be used, such as https://www.example.com</p>
            <p><b>Relative Links</b> are links to other pages within our own website. These do not include
            the domain name, as it is simply another page on our site.</p>
            <p>If our relative link redirects us to a page in a different directory, we must reference 
                this directory in the link, such as <b>pages/example.html</b>
            </p>
            <h4>Images.</h4>
            <p>
                Websites often contain images, as without them they may seem fairly boring. Luckily however,
                HTML provides a wide variety of elements for displaying different types of media, with the
                most widely used of these being the image element.
            </p>
            <p>
                To display an image in HTML we use the &lt;img&gt; element. Unlike the other elements
                we have used, the img element is a void element, meaning it does not need a closing tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embed an image into 
                the page using a src attribute, telling the browser where the image file is located. The 
                src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. Images can also be embedded
                using both absolute and relative paths, also seen in the achor element.
            </p>
            <h4>Alt Attribute.</h4>
            <p>
                Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is used to describe an image, which will be in the image's place if it cannot be
                loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired users.
            </p>
            <h4>Image Size Attributes.</h4>
            <p>
                While not required, specifying the height and width of an image helps the browser
                layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be good practice to always specify these attributes on every image, even 
                when the image is the correct size, or you are using CSS to modify it.
