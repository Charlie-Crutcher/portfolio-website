                <h2>Lesson 1 - What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript?</h2>
                <h3>What are the main three languages used?</h3>
                <p><b>1: What is HTML?</b> It is a language that determines how documents 
                    and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for 
                    the building blocks of any website.
                </p>
                <p><b>2: What is CSS?</b> CSS, or 'Cascading Style Sheets', is a popular
                    style sheet language that determines how a document in HTML is styled, such
                    as it's colours, fonts, layout and responsive features.
                </p>
                <p><b>3: What is JavaScript?</b> JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML 
                    elements on your website after the site has been loaded, giving you the ability
                    to make your site more interactive and engaging for users with animations, embedded
                    video media and more.</p>
                <p><b>These three programming languages typically lay the foundations of any website,
                    which is why it is important that you are aware of how these languages function, 
                    how they may affect your website and what they are typically used for.
                </b></p>
                <br>
                <h2>TL:DR</h2>
                <p><b>HTML</b> Creates the structure</p>
                <p><b>CSS</b> Stylizes the website</p>
                <p><b>JavaScript</b> Increases interactivity</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Additional Languages</h3>
                <p>Websites may use a wide range of different programming languages, with some being more
                    complex than others.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the more common web dev languages consist of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, Ruby and SQL,
                    however, the primary languages (HTML, CSS and JS) should be enough to understand the basics.

                <h2>Lesson 2 - Elements and Tags</h2>
                <p>HTML defines the structure and content of webpages. HTML elements are what creates all of the
                    paragraphs, headings, lists, images and links that make up a typical website.
                </p>
                <h3>Elements and Tags</h3>
                <p>Almost all elements on a HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing tags.</p>
                <p>Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of a HTML element, and closing tags tell the browser
                    where the element ends. They both consist of angle bracks with a word in them. &lt;p&gt;
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    HTML has a vast <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">list</a> of
                    predefined tags, and it is important to use the correct tags for content for two reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Reason 1: </b>It has a direct impact on how the website is ranked in search engines.<br>
                    <b>Reason 2: </b>It increases accessibility for users who rely on assitive technologies such as screen readers. <br>
                    Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Void Elements</h3>
                <p>Some HTML elements don't have a closing tag, instead just having a single tag such as &lt;br&gt;. 
                    These are known as void elements becauase they are void of any content, due to them having no closing tag.
                </p>

                <p>Tags essentially tell the computer where the content starts and where the content stops.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Lesson 3 - HTML Boilerplate</h2>
                <p>All HTML documents have the same basic structure or boilerplate, that needs to be in place before anything useful can be done.</p>
                <h3>The DOCTYPE</h3>
                <p>Every HTML page starts with a ductype declaration. The doctype's purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should
                    use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is !DOCTYPE html.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the doctype is declared, you need to provide a &lt;html&gt; element.
                    This is what's known as the root element of the ducment, meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This becomes more important later on when we learn about manipulating HTML with JavaScript, but for now, just know that the &lt;html&gt;
                    element should be included on every HTML document.
                </p>
                <p>The lang attribute specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility
                    of the webpage, allowing for assistive technologies to adapt according to the language.
                </p>
                <h3>Head Element</h3>
                <p>
                    The &lt;head&gt; element is where we put important meta-information <b>about</b> our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render
                    correctly in the browser. Inside the head element, we <b>should not</b> use any element that displays content.
                </p>
                <h4>Meta Element</h4>
                <p>
                    A meta tag should always be included in the head element, as it ensure that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from
                    different languages correctly in the browser.
                </p>
                <h4>Title Element</h4>
                <p>The title element is used to change the text in the webpage's browser tab.</p>
                <h3>Body Element</h3>
                <p>
                    The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the body element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users
                    will go; the text, images, lists etc.
