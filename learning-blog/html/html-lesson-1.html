            <h2>Lesson 1 - What is HTML, CSS and JavaScript?</h2>
            <h3>Date: 2nd October 2024</h3>
            <h3>What are the main three languages used?</h3>
            <p><b>1: What is HTML?</b> It is a language that determines how documents 
                and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for 
                the building blocks of any website.
            </p>
            <p><b>2: What is CSS?</b> CSS, or 'Cascading Style Sheets', is a popular
                style sheet language that determines how a document in HTML is styled, such
                as it's colours, fonts, layout and responsive features.
            </p>
            <p><b>3: What is JavaScript?</b> JavaScript allows you to change CSS and HTML 
                elements on your website after the site has been loaded, giving you the ability
                to make your site more interactive and engaging for users with animations, embedded
                video media and more.</p>
            <p><b>These three programming languages typically lay the foundations of any website,
                which is why it is important that you are aware of how these languages function, 
                how they may affect your website and what they are typically used for.
            </b></p>
            <br>
            <h2>TL:DR</h2>
            <p><b>HTML</b> Creates the structure</p>
            <p><b>CSS</b> Stylizes the website</p>
            <p><b>JavaScript</b> Increases interactivity</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Additional Languages</h3>
            <p>Websites may use a wide range of different programming languages, with some being more
                complex than others.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the more common web dev languages consist of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, Ruby and SQL,
                however, the primary languages (HTML, CSS and JS) should be enough to understand the basics.
