            <h2>Commit Messages.</h2>
            <p>
                It is important to keep a history of good commit messages. This lesson will cover
                how to write them, when to commit and why they are important.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Why are commit messages important?</h4>
            <p>
                When applying for jobs, employers will look through your GitHub projects and therefor,
                your commit history. Having a good commit practice as a novice developer will help you
                stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a good commit history will also allow you and other developers to see what
                changes were made and why, quickly and efficiently. This is especially useful if a bug
                is found in the code that needs to be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                A good commit message history will also help if you are coming back to a project
                on which you haven't worked on for a while. It will help you remember the thought
                process behind the code, aswell as any changes made.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Bad vs. Good Commits.</h4>
            <p>
                It is important to know how to write commits effectively. Simply writing: 'fix a bug'
                is an example of a bad commit, as it is far too vague. A good commit message explains
                <b>why</b> the changes have been made. It should describe <b>what</b> problem your
                changes solve and <b>how</b> it solves them.
            </p>
            <p>Effective commits contain two parts: the subject and the body.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Subject</h5>
            <p>A brief summary of the change you made to the project</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> 'This is the change I made to the codebase'.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> GitHub has a 72-character limit for commits, so it is recommended to keep
                commit subjects within this amount.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Body</h5>
            <p>A concice, yet clear description of the changes made.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Describe the problem your commit solves and how.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Example of a good commit</b></p>
            <p>Instead of writing simply 'fix a bug'. We can write this instead:</p>
            <br>
            <p>(Subject)Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo</p>
            <p>(Body)Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Why this is effective.</h5>
            <p>
                It provides a subject that specifies your code's action ('Add missing link and alt
                 text to the companies logo)
            </p>
            <p>
                It contains a body that provides a clear, but concise description of why the commit
                 needed to be made ('Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities
                 without this information')
            </p>
            <p>
                Separates the subject from the body with a new/blank line. This is a best practice
                that is highly recommended to follow, as it makes commit messages easier to read.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>How to commit with a subject and body in the message.</h4>
            <p>
                Up until now, it is most likely that we have been using 'git commit -m "message"'.
                To make a commit with a subject and body in message, you can simply write 'git commit'
                without the -m flag and message argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doing this will open a new Visual Studio Code tab. Which will allow you to enter 
                multi-lined messages. When saved and closed, the commit will be created.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>When to commit.</h4>
            <p>
                A commit can be thought of like a 'snapshot' of your code at the moment it was made.
                That version of your code up to that point will be saved, allowing you to revert
                back to or look back at.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best practice considered for commits is to commit every time you make a meaningful
                change in the code. This creates a timeline of your progress, showing that your
                finished code didn't simply appear out of thin air (or made with AI).
            </p>
            <p>
                Make a commit when you get a piece of code you are working on to function as you
                intended it to, when you fix a typo, or when you fix a bug. As you gain experience,
                you will eventually develop a better feel for what should be commited and when.
